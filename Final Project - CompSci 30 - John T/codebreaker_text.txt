Codebreaker

The goal of the game is to guess the randomized 4 digit number.
This is done by guessing what the 4 digit number is and using 
the information provided to solve the code.

When you submit a guess, a string would appear in the column beside it 
with characters hinting to what is right, sort of right, or wrong.

In the string, a number would represent a correct number and position.
A 'Y' indicates a correct number but wrong place, and a 'X'
represents a wrong number.
