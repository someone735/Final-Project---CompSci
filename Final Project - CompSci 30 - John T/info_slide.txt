Encryption is a method of hiding information by converting it 
into a special code.

Encryption works by taking in a message and using an encryption 
algorithm or cipher and a key, the cipher changes the message 
according to the key and creates a unique scrambled message.

One of the earliest uses of encryption dates back to 600 BC 
when ancient Spartans would wrap a leather strap around a pole 
and write their message on it before sending it off. When 
unwrapped or wrapped around a different pole, the message 
would be gibberish to another person, but when wrapped around 
the correct pole, the message would be decrypted.

Encryption is very beneficial when it comes to protecting 
one’s information for it encodes it to keep the information 
safe and the receiver can verify if the message has been 
tampered with by using a pre-agreed upon key.

An example of a cipher would be Ceaser’s Cipher. Caesar’s Cipher 
is based on taking letters from the original message and 
shifting them a certain amount in the alphabet which leaves us 
with an encoded message. You can see a version of this when 
using the encryption and decryption functions in the main menu.
